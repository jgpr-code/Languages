# Languages
Collect code samples of different languages to familiarize with similarities and differences between languages

I want to evaluate different languages based on their Ecosystem, capabilities, setup, documentation, ...

I'm still not decided what toy example I can use to test that, but it should cover some of these aspects:

- Async/Multithreading/Parallelism
- Web
- Multi-User
- Performance
- Language Ecosystem (Libs, Tooling, ...)

## The Languages

- Rust
- C++
- C
- Zig
- TypeScript
- Haskell
- F#
- C#
- Kotlin
- Clojure
- Python
- Powershell
